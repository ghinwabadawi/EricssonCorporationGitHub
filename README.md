Java Assignment
Assignment Java:

1.	 Why Add Employee class. In real life example this is how it would be done. Now although it could have been achieved using the Collection framework to store info about the employee (like the Name, Hour Rate, Hours worked) but for me it just doesn't separate the logic well and doesn't define the Employee as a separate entity.
2.	Why JUnit 4.10 not 4.12 
because 4.12 has caused: initializationError did a small research about it, tried few things and it didnâ€™t work. So I chose not to put too much time on it.
3.	I separated getTotalPay from calcTotalPay just to separate the user friendly output from the calculation of the totalpay. And also so that we can easily unit test the calculation function.
